# Background Processing Roadmap for Desiru

## Current State

The Desiru background processing system now includes:
- ✅ Sidekiq integration for job processing
- ✅ Redis for fast job status tracking
- ✅ Database persistence for long-term job result storage
- ✅ Async module capabilities
- ✅ Job status tracking and progress updates
- ✅ Batch processing support

## Proposed Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Retry Strategies (Priority: High)
Implement sophisticated retry mechanisms for failed jobs:
- **Exponential backoff** with jitter to prevent thundering herd
- **Circuit breaker pattern** for external service failures
- **Dead letter queue** for jobs that exceed retry limits
- **Custom retry policies** per job type

### 2. Job Scheduling and Cron Support (Priority: Medium)
Add support for scheduled and recurring jobs:
- **Cron-style scheduling** using Sidekiq-cron or similar
- **Delayed job execution** with precise timing
- **Recurring optimization tasks** for model improvements
- **Scheduled cleanup jobs** for expired data

### 3. Workflow Orchestration (Priority: Medium)
Enable complex multi-step workflows:
- **Job dependencies** - jobs that wait for others to complete
- **Parallel execution** with fan-out/fan-in patterns
- **Conditional branching** based on job results
- **Workflow visualization** and monitoring

### 4. Enhanced Monitoring and Alerting (Priority: High)
Improve visibility into job processing:
- **Real-time dashboards** for job metrics
- **Performance analytics** per job type
- **Alert thresholds** for queue depth and processing time
- **Integration with monitoring services** (Datadog, New Relic, etc.)

### 5. Webhook and Callback System (Priority: Low)
Notify external systems of job events:
- **Configurable webhooks** for job completion/failure
- **Event streaming** for real-time updates
- **Retry logic** for failed webhook deliveries
- **Security features** (HMAC signatures, etc.)

### 6. Resource Management (Priority: Medium)
Optimize resource usage:
- **Dynamic worker scaling** based on queue depth
- **Memory limits** per job type
- **CPU throttling** for resource-intensive jobs
- **Priority-based resource allocation**

### 7. Testing Improvements (Priority: High)
Enhance testing capabilities:
- **Job testing helpers** for easier unit tests
- **Performance benchmarking** framework
- **Chaos engineering** tools for resilience testing
- **Mock job execution** for integration tests

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1** (Immediate):
   - Advanced retry strategies
   - Enhanced monitoring and alerting
   - Testing improvements

2. **Phase 2** (Near-term):
   - Job scheduling and cron support
   - Workflow orchestration basics
   - Resource management

3. **Phase 3** (Long-term):
   - Full workflow orchestration
   - Webhook and callback system
   - Advanced resource optimization

## Benefits

- **Reliability**: Better retry strategies reduce job failures
- **Scalability**: Resource management enables efficient scaling
- **Visibility**: Enhanced monitoring provides operational insights
- **Flexibility**: Workflow orchestration enables complex use cases
- **Integration**: Webhooks allow seamless external system integration
